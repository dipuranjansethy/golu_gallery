              Baby, this special message is for you: You mean everything to me. You make me feel so special and important. 
              You never put ego like other girls. I am not comparing you to any other because you are awesome, special, 
              and unique. You put all your efforts into making me happy and obey my wishes. I love you so much. 
              I don't know how to express all this overwhelming love, but one thing I can say is that you are the most 
              beautiful and amazing thing that happened to me. You lightened my world like nobody else. 
              <br><br>
              Your kisses are the sweetest thing I have ever known. You make me feel secure and ready to make so many 
              sacrifices for you. I want to see you as the happiest and most satisfied girl ever. Baby, I love you soooooo much! 
              I will love you until the earth stops revolving around the sun, even if you grow as fat as 100 kg or get wrinkles on your face. 
              You will always be my hot, sexy, cute <b>darling</b>. 
              <br><br>
              I could write a 1000-page love letter for you because my feelings are endless. But I know I can't fit everything here because 
              the page would look cluttered. So here's a little end to this note:
          </p>
          <div class="letter-ending">
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: medium;">

                  Your pagal bachhu, <br>
